// BORGAS Asset Creator (BAC) - release and pricing facts for the website.
//
// UPDATE THIS FILE WITH EVERY BAC RELEASE. The download URL must be the signed
// installer that the "Publish BAC update to Cloudflare R2" workflow put on
// updates.borgas.us, and sha256 must match its .sha256 file. Installed copies
// (1.3.0 and later) update themselves from the signed feed at
// https://updates.borgas.us/stable.json, so this page is only for new buyers.
//
// PURCHASING: BAC is sold through the borgas.us shop (opened 2026-09-23). The
// production Worker issues the license key after payment; it appears on the
// buyer's account page. checkoutLive=false returns to email/invoice sales.
